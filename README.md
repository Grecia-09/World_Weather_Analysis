# World_Weather_Analysis

The head of Analysis for the user interface team of a travel technology company asked me to help him collect and present data for customers via de search page that they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel in the world. 

I created a series of scatter plots to show the relationship between the latitude and a variety of weather parameters over 500 hundred cities around the world and perform linear regression on the weather parameters in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, this data will help predict the best time of year for people to plan their vacation. 

After the analysis, I used the weather data to choose the best cities for vacations based in some weather criteria and then map these cities using Jupyter gmaps and the Google places API.
